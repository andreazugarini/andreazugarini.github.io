We present a deep architecture in the framework of Learning from Constraints that is trained to identify mentions to entities and relations belonging to a given ontology. Each input word is encoded into two latent representations with different coverage of the local context, that are exploited to predict the type of entity and of relation to which the word belongs. Our model combines an entropy-based regularizer and a set of First-Order Logic formulas that bridge the predictions on entity and relation types accordingly to the ontology structure. As a result, the system generates symbolic descriptions of the raw text that are interpretable and well-suited to attach human-level knowledge. We evaluate the model on a dataset composed of sentences about simple facts, that we make publicly available. The proposed system can efficiently learn to discover mentions with very few human supervisions and that the relation to knowledge in the form of logic constraints improves the quality of the system predictions.","tags":[],"title":"Combining deep learning and symbolic processing for extracting knowledge from raw text","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marco Maggini","Giuseppe Marra","Stefano Melacci","Andrea Zugarini"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600626553,"objectID":"6dd510f755cd4399a1e368d47168f4c4","permalink":"/publication/maggini-2019-learning/","publishdate":"2020-09-20T18:29:12.339924Z","relpermalink":"/publication/maggini-2019-learning/","section":"publication","summary":"We consider a scenario where an artificial agent is reading a stream of text composed of a set of narrations, and it is informed about the identity of some of the individuals that are mentioned in the text portion that is currently being read.

Conversational systems can exploit automatic paraphrasing to make the conversation more natural, e.g., talking about a certain topic using different paraphrases in different time instants. Recently, the task of automatically generating paraphrases has been approached in the context of Natural Language Generation (NLG). While many existing systems simply consist in rule-based models, the recent success of the Deep Neural Networks in several NLG tasks naturally suggests the possibility of exploiting such networks for generating paraphrases. However, the main obstacle toward neural-network-based paraphrasing is the lack of large datasets with aligned pairs of sentences and paraphrases, that are needed to efficiently train the neural models. In this paper we present a method for the automatic generation of large aligned corpora, that is based on the assumption that news and blog websites talk about the same events using different narrative styles. We propose a similarity search procedure with linguistic constraints that, given a reference sentence, is able to locate the most similar candidate paraphrases out from millions of indexed sentences. The data generation process is evaluated in the case of the Italian language, performing experiments using pointer-based deep neural architectures.","tags":[],"title":"Neural Paraphrasing by Automatically Crawled and Aligned Sentence Pairs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andrea Zugarini","Stefano Melacci","Marco Maggini"],"categories":["Poem Generation","Language Modeling"],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600626555,"objectID":"b9208f015899a14996875c64886ccfa2","permalink":"/publication/zugarini-2019-neural/","publishdate":"2020-09-20T18:29:15.037988Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zugarini-2019-neural/","section":"publication","summary":"Motivated by the recent progresses on machine learning-based models that learn artistic styles, in this paper we focus on the problem of poem generation. This is a challenging task in which the machine has to capture the linguistic features that strongly characterize a certain poet, as well as the semantics of the poet’s production, that are influenced by his personal experiences and by his literary background. Since poetry is constructed using syllables, that regulate the form and structure of poems, we propose a syllable-based neural language model, and we describe a poem generation mechanism that is designed around the poet style, automatically selecting the most representative generations. The poetic work of a target author is usually not enough to successfully train modern deep neural networks, so we propose a multi-stage procedure that exploits non-poetic works of the same author, and also other publicly available huge corpora to learn syntax and grammar of the target language. We focus on the Italian poet Dante Alighieri, widely famous for his Divine Comedy. A quantitative and qualitative experimental analysis of the generated tercets is reported, where we included expert judges with strong background in humanistic studies. The generated tercets are frequently considered to be real by a generic population of judges, with relative difference of 56.25% with respect to the ones really authored by Dante, and expert judges perceived Dante’s style and rhymes in the generated text.","tags":["Natural Language Generation","Poem Generation","Language Modeling","Syllable-based Language Models"],"title":"Neural Poetry: Learning to Generate Poems Using Syllables","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ottavia Spiga","Vittoria Cicaloni","Andrea Zatkova","Lia Millucci","Giulia Bernardini","Andrea Bernini","Barbara Marzocchi","Monica Bianchini","Andrea Zugarini","Alberto Rossi"," others"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600626556,"objectID":"c587fe0cd2c1daef920a434642e12a4c","permalink":"/publication/spiga-2018-new/","publishdate":"2020-09-20T18:29:15.817685Z","relpermalink":"/publication/spiga-2018-new/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"A new integrated and interactive tool applicable to inborn errors of metabolism: Application to alkaptonuria","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francesco Giannini","Vincenzo Laveglia","Alessandro Rossi","Dario Zanca","Andrea Zugarini"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600626558,"objectID":"aedfa11b25e976463660e6be1b7b3d52","permalink":"/publication/giannini-2017-neural/","publishdate":"2020-09-20T18:29:16.963121Z","relpermalink":"/publication/giannini-2017-neural/","section":"publication","summary":"This report provides an introduction to some Machine Learning tools within the most common development environments.
