 abstract = {Paraphrasing is the task of re-writing an input text using other words, without altering the meaning of the original content. Conversational systems can exploit automatic paraphrasing to make the conversation more natural, e.g., talking about a certain topic using different paraphrases in different time instants. Recently, the task of automatically generating paraphrases has been approached in the context of Natural Language Generation (NLG). While many existing systems simply consist in rule-based models, the recent success of the Deep Neural Networks in several NLG tasks naturally suggests the possibility of exploiting such networks for generating paraphrases. However, the main obstacle toward neural-network-based paraphrasing is the lack of large datasets with aligned pairs of sentences and paraphrases, that are needed to efficiently train the neural models. In this paper we present a method for the automatic generation of large aligned corpora, that is based on the assumption that news and blog websites talk about the same events using different narrative styles. We propose a similarity search procedure with linguistic constraints that, given a reference sentence, is able to locate the most similar candidate paraphrases out from millions of indexed sentences. The data generation process is evaluated in the case of the Italian language, performing experiments using pointer-based deep neural architectures.},
