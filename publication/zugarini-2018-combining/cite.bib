	abstract={This paper faces the problem of extracting knowledge from
	raw text. We present a deep architecture in the framework of Learning
	from Constraints that is trained to identify mentions to entities and
	relations belonging to a given ontology. Each input word is encoded into
	two latent representations with different coverage of the local context,
	that are exploited to predict the type of entity and of relation to which
	the word belongs. Our model combines an entropy-based regularizer and
	a set of First-Order Logic formulas that bridge the predictions on entity
	and relation types accordingly to the ontology structure. As a result, the
	system generates symbolic descriptions of the raw text that are interpretable and well-suited to attach human-level knowledge. We evaluate the model on a dataset composed of sentences about simple facts, that
	we make publicly available. The proposed system can efficiently learn to discover mentions with very few human supervisions and that the relation to knowledge in the form of logic constraints improves the quality
	of the system predictions.}
